write fibonacci function in python

** Ellama:
Sure! Here's the implementation of a Fibonacci sequence generator using Python:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    A function that generates the nth number of Fibonacci series.
    :param n: The nth term you want to generate.
    :return: An integer value representing the nth term of Fibonacci series.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    first = 0
    second = 1
    
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        next_term = first + second
        first = second
        second = next_term
        
    return second
#+END_SRC

The ~fibonacci()~ function takes a parameter ~n~, which represents the nth term you want to generate
in the Fibonacci series. It returns an integer value representing the nth term of the series. The
implementation uses two variables, ~first~ and ~second~, to keep track of the current and previous
terms, respectively. Then, it repeatedly generates the next term using a loop with range
function. The first two terms are hardcoded as ~0~ and ~1~, respectively. Inside the loop, it
calculates the value of the next term by adding the current and previous terms and updates the
values of the ~first~ and ~second~ variables accordingly. Finally, it returns the value of ~second~
variable representing the nth term of Fibonacci series. Let me know if you have any questions or
concerns!

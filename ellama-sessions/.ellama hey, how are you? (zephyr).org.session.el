Here's the implementation of a Fibonacci sequence generator using Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    \"\"\"
    A function that generates the nth number of Fibonacci series.
    :param n: The nth term you want to generate.
    :return: An integer value representing the nth term of Fibonacci series.
    \"\"\"
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    first = 0
    second = 1
    
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        next_term = first + second
        first = second
        second = next_term
        
    return second
```

The `fibonacci()` function takes a parameter `n`, which represents the nth term you want to generate in the Fibonacci series. It returns an integer value representing the nth term of the series. The implementation uses two variables, `first` and `second`, to keep track of the current and previous terms, respectively. Then, it repeatedly generates the next term using a loop with range function. The first two terms are hardcoded as `0` and `1`, respectively. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of the next term by adding the current and previous terms and updates the values of the `first` and `second` variables accordingly. Finally, it returns the value of `second` variable representing the nth term of Fibonacci series. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!" nil)) nil nil nil nil) nil)
